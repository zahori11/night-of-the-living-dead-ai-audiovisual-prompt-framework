Clone @imgN : Clone Minimal terror scene rendered as authentic original Game Boy LCD pixel art, strict 1-bit black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF), no grayscale—only hard pixel clusters. 
Resolution 160x144, chunky 8x8 sprite grid visible. A single rotating light source simulated through frame-by-frame sprite inversion. No gradients—only stark pixel blocks and aggressive dithering patterns. Empty white background as blank cartridge void. 
Emphasize strong sprite silhouettes, heavy negative space, and limited animation frames like a paused boss encounter before defeat. 
Inspired by early horror homebrew ROMs and 1990s handheld limitations. Cinematic framing within a Game Boy screen border overlay, subtle LCD ghosting effect, raw binary dread.
